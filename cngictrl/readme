Fix the bug for
	1.When gprs/3G is first on (auto off), then if wlan is on, it will not delete the route of rmnet
	2.Can not set wifi when auto off on rmnet (in "to" cmd and "bmisscntDetect" func)
	3.Fix many small bugs

	Note:
	Please follow the principles below when playing the system (current situation):
	1.At the begining when one card is on and auto is off, if you turn the other card and then handoff to it,
	  the system will not recognize it (since the previous card is different and only one card status is
	  allowed in the mn and ha).
	2.If 1 happens, trigger it by switching the AP when using wlan card, or do handoff.
	3.Due to 1, the best routine is, a. auto on and make both cards availuable (first wlan, and then rmnet)
	  -> b. auto off and do handoff
	4.Never do "wifi off" cmd (and maybe touch screen to make rmnet off) when the card is already on. Or it
	  will cause fatal problem (send to 0.0.0.0 address).
